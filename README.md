# Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis Using Excel

## Objective
The Coffee Shop aims to create a 6-month sales report (January to June) to understand customer behavior and enhance sales growth from July onward. I have developed an advanced Coffee Shop Dashboard using Excel to achieve this goal.

## Sample Insights
* Weekdays have higher sales than weekends (~60)
* The top three products based on sales are Barista Espresso, Brewed Chai Tea, and Hot Chocolate (~50)
* The peak time for sales is from 9 AM to 10 AM daily (~70)
* Coffee and Tea contribute more to this shop's revenue than Bakery and Branded items (~66)

## Final Conclusion to improve Coffee shop sales:
To enhance coffee shop sales, introduce a wider variety of beverages such as **Barista Espresso, Brewed Chai Tea, and Hot Chocolate** during **peak hours (9 AM to 10 AM)**, particularly on **weekdays**.
